       Welcome to GameGrid
       </p>
       <p id='text1'>
       &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;GameGrid is a special in-console game. By in-console, we mean, there's nothing much to see. It's run on a special code (programming) language called Ruby. You might already know this powerful language. The game has one prominent goal: to defeat evil Zuki, and win back the Royal Eyes. The game makes you feel blind, as the only way to control your actions and see info is to command. Commands look like<span id='textspan'> </span><span id='textspan1'>fall()</span><span id='textspan2'> </span>and <span id='textspan3'>pickup(:weapon</span><span id='textspan4'>)</span> and more.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; The actual game must be played in either Ruby Online, or in your Command Line (Command Prompt, Terminal (Mac), iTerm, VNC, etc). If you are on a Mac (), then you already have Ruby, so you can play in your command line (offline) with the instructions below. If you are on Windows, install Ruby from htpp://www.rubyinstaller.org and then you can do offline play. For online play, or if offline play fails, follow the Online instructions below.<br /><br />

             OFFLINE (command line) INSTRUCTIONS: First, make sure you have Ruby installed. Ruby is already installed on Apple Macs with OS X. On Windows computers, you may install it from htpp://www.rubyinstaller.org, if you don't already have it. Ruby is the code driver necessary for the game. You do not need NVidia GForce Graphics, but you may have it if wanted. Now make sure you have the GameGrid.rb file that came with this one. Open that file. You might see some code language you may not understand. Just select all (control+A or command+A) and copy it (control+C or command+C). Go to your command line window (Terminal/CP) and type irb. Now paste all the code (ctrl+V or command+V) and hit enter (mac: return). Type play to begin.
       </p>

                 ONLINE (in-browser) INSTRUCTIONS: First, make sure you have the latest version of a modern browser installed. Some modern browsers include Google Chrome, Safari, FireFox, Internet Explorer, and Opera (but we reccommend Google Chrome at http://chrome.com/download/). Now go to http://learnstreet.com/scratchpad/ruby in that browser. Now leave that tab open, and go to Finder/Library and locate the GameGrid.rb file that came with this one. Open it with a text editor. Copy all the code you see (you may not be able to understand it, but that's fine). Go to that tab in your browser. On the left, there is a white code editor. Paste everything you copied, there.  Click the check-mark button in the right side of that white editor. Click the black editor, on the right side of the page. Type play, and hit enter to begin.<br />
