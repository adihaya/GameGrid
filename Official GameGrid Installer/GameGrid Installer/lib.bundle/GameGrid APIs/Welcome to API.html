       Welcome to GameGrid APIs
       </p>
        <br> <br><br><br><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
       <p id='text1'>
       &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hello, we see you have interest in learning about the GG API, or the code it took to build GameGrid. GameGrid is a special in-console game. By in-console, we mean, there's nothing much to see. It's run on a special code (programming) language called Ruby. You might already know this powerful language. If you don't, then learn all about it at <a href="http://www.learnstreet.com/lessons/study/ruby">The Free Ruby for Beginners course</a>. Ruby is an unbelievably powerful language, and is similar to javascript, but has lots of hidden syntax changes, and more. After you finish that course, be sure to check out one of the <a href="http://www.learnstreet.com/cg/simple/projects/ruby">Ruby Simple Projects</a>. When done, come back here, and read below. If you think you already have a very strong understanding of Ruby, you can also skip ahead and read below.       </p>

             Okay, so GameGrid API's are COMPLETELY written in Ruby. Make sure you read the paragraph above here, also. Now, you should know about classes, File methods, variables, functions, methods, rescue commands, and more. If not, check out the advanced stuff you don't know, here at <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/index.htm">Ruby Tutorial Point</a>. If you have then, you are completely ready for this. The GameGrid API is only built in the Ruby (*.rb) language, and uses classes, functions, logging, etc to control GameGrid. Make sure you have an understanding of the Ruby <span id="textspan2">eval(string)</span> method. eval() takes in a string argument. All it does, is it runs the argument string as if it were part of the code. So doing eval("a=13+5") would have NO difference to just doing a=13+5. If you comprehend this, continue, and read the note:
           <br><br>
           NOTE: Before beginnning, locate the GameGrid.rb file. Also, make sure to open a command line (Command Prompt or Mac Terminal) window and change directories to the folder the GameGrid.rb file is located in. Also, install or open a new window in Google Chrome (www.chrome.com). Chrome is the best tool to test it out. When done, go to the next paragraph.

                 We need to first UNDERSTAND the GameGrid.rb file, so locate it in Finder/Library and open it with a plain text editor (we reccomend Adobe Edge Code CC, or Sublime Text 3). You should see the first line begins with '#' and is a comment. If you don't open the file in another text editor, where you do. Now read all the code you see, and try well to understand what exactly the code is doing. To really comprehend it, add '#' comments to every line explaining the line. If you added comments, save and send your new commented file to tt2d[at]icloud[dot]com, and we'll see if you understood it, and reply with some insights. If you comprehended the code well, you shuold see two classes, Point and Grid, which interconnect methods. You should see the "play" function, which uses command=gets and eval(command) to execute the user's command. Now, go and test out some stuff, like create a new instance of the grid class, and play around with it, or call the play method, and go through it. Now, you should understand totally how it works. Save any changes you made in a new git repository, forked off from the GameGrid repo, at <a href="http://github.com/adihaya/GameGrid/">GitHub/GameGrid.</a>Send an email to tt2d[at]icloud[dot]com with the link of your public git repository, and we'll take a peek. Play around with the API for a while, and update your git repository whenever posibble. Keep making new sections to the play function, an have fun messing around! Our GitHub link isat the bottom of this page.<br /><br>
           NOTE: The BEST WAY TO LEARN the API's, are not to mess around with the original file, but to use "require 'GameGrid'" to load it into another new file, and edit and add new stuff.
